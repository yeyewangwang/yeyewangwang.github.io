        <h3>Context</h3>
        <p>The Ising model was created nearly 100 years ago as a
        universal model to study phase transitions and the formation
        of patterns during such events. Hugo Duminil-Copin won 2022 Fields Medal
        for proving that phase transitions exist only in the dimensions of 2, 3 and 4.</p>

        <h3>The Science</h3>
        <p>Each particle has a fixed number of "neighbors". Changing one particle
        implies changing its interation with all neighbors, which recursively impacts
        2nd degree neighbors (this is also a reason this topic is intrigueingly computational). Higher dimension typically implies larger number of neighbors;
        however, it is possible to pack more neighbors in a lower dimension.</p>

            <div class="col-md-12">
                <img class="center-block img-fluid border border-dark"

        </div>
        <p>In the above 2-D figure, each particle has 6 neighbors, same as in 3-D where
            each particle can be seen as a cube with 6 faces and thus 6 neighbors. The
            number of neighbors is the same, but simulations in this study show that phase
        transitions happen at a lower temperature in the 2-D figure.</p>

        <h3>Engineering</h3>
        <div class="design-step">
        <p>The lattice has been divided into a grid system, each
            block would be computed on its individual thread.</p>
        <div class="row align-items-center">
            <div class="col-md-12">
                <img class="center-block img-fluid border border-dark"
                             src="./images/monte_carlo/blocks.png"/>
            </div>
        </div>
        <p>The code reindexes any point on the grid into each thread's
            proprietory memory if it is in the blue region, any point
            into shared memory if it is in the red region. At the minimum,
            the simulation can operate on two threads at the same time, leading to a
            constant-factor speedup.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="design-step">
        <p>In addition, it is now possible to snapshot the system half-way through
            a simulation.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>The Reason I'm in this</h3>
        <p>I chose this project
            to keep abreast of the latest developments in probability theory especially given I have worked on a couple other related areas. The software package is one of the
            few open-source packages that produce cluster formations in the 3 dimensinonal space.
