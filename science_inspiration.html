        <p>I've worked with many applied physicists and physicists.
            The secret to their success in engineering boils down
        to one question, "is this physical?".</p>

        <p>In physics, "is this physical?" prompts the researcher
        to look into the meaning of the mathematics. If I have an equation with
        two terms, and I see my solution dropping down at one point,
        then maybe one of the two terms is responsible for the drop.
        Then, the question leads you to figure out which one it is.</p>
